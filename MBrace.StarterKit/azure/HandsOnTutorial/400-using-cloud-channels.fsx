 This tutorial illustrates creating and using cloud channels, which allow you to send messages between
 cloud workflows.
 
 Before running, edit credentials.fsx to enter your connection strings.

// First connect to the cluster
let cluster = Runtime.GetHandle(config)

// Create an anonymous cloud channel
let send1,recv1 = CloudChannel.New<string>() |> cluster.Run

// Send to the channel by scheduling a cloud process to do the send 
CloudChannel.Send (send1, "hello") |> cluster.Run

// Receive from the channel by scheduling a cloud process to do the receive 
let msg = CloudChannel.Receive(recv1) |> cluster.Run

let sendJob = 
    cloud { for i in [ 0 .. 100 ] do 
                do! send1.Send (sprintf "hello%d" i) }
     |> cluster.CreateProcess

sendJob.ShowInfo() 

// Await for the 100 messages.  
let receiveJob = 
    cloud { let results = new ResizeArray<_>()
            for i in [ 0 .. 100 ] do 
               let! msg = CloudChannel.Receive(recv1)
               results.Add msg
