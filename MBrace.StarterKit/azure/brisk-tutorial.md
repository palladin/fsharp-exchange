# Get Started With Brisk

Steps to create an [MBrace](http://m-brace.net/) Cluster on [Azure](https://windowsazure.com) using [Elastacloud Brisk Engine](https://www.briskengine.com/#/dash) as of 20/02/2015. See [the announcement of the pre-release availability](http://blog.brisk.elastatools.com/2015/02/19/adding-support-for-mbrace-f-and-net-on-brisk/) of this service.

Assumes you have an Azure account with at least 4 cores spare (there is a 20 core limit on some free or trial Azure accounts).

1. Create an account with [Brisk](https://www.briskengine.com/), including entering your Azure account 
   connection token details. When you select "Download Azure settings" Brisk will 
   automatically take you to the Azure page that downloads a settings file.  
   You then load those settings into Brisk to complete creating your account.

2. Create a new storage account in the [Azure Console](https://manage.windowsazure.com) (any name) or use 
   an existing storage account.  Keep an eye on which data center you created your storage account in.

3. Create a new MBrace cluster in [Brisk console](https://www.briskengine.com/#/dash) (use any name). 
   Specify the right data centre (the same one as the storage account) and the right storage account.  
   This will take 5-10 minutes.

4. Fetch the connection string details for your cluster  from Brisk 
   by clicking on your cluster details, and looking at the Connection Strings tab. 
   These will be needed in the next step.

5. Download the contents of this repository as a ZIP (or clone) and open in 
   Visual Studio 2013.  If you don't have Visual Studio 2013, see http://fsharp.org/use/windows to get it.

6. In Visual Studio 2013, reset F# Interactive, enter the connection strings into the ``credentials.fsx``  script:

        let myStorageConnectionString = "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=..."
        let myServiceBusConnectionString = "Endpoint=sb://brisk..."

Now go through the hands-on tutorials in the starter pack.  Read things carefully and 
take it step by step, don't execute the entire scripts in F# Interactive but 
rather take the time to execute each piece of code and understand what it's doing.

Some examples of using the hands-on tutorials are below:

* Call runtime.GetHandle(config):

        let runtime = Runtime.GetHandle(config)

  giving

        val runtime : Runtime

* Call runtime.ShowWorkers():

        Workers

* Create a cloud computation:

        let job =
            cloud { return sprintf "run in the cloud on worker '%s' " Environment.MachineName }
            |> runtime.CreateProcess
